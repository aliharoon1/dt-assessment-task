## About Changes

X. Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. 
How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic. The more details that you can provide about the 
code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

<li>Solid Principle Applied</li>
<li>PSR</li>

IMPORTANT: I have created two branches. First `master` with original code. Second `dev` with my refactored code, and I created a Pull request, so you can easily trace changes.


Thank you!
